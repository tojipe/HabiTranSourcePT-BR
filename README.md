## HabiTranSource ![Icon.png](https://snipboard.io/vQki5Z.jpg)
This is a project created with the intent of gathering Habitica's technical terms and common **strings** of translation into a collaborative spreadsheet. It also provides a tool that allows for **discussion** 🗨 about the translation of terms. 

It works by means of code in **VBA**. To use it, simply download the spreadsheet **(in xlsm format)**, open it, and activate the use of VBA in your 📊 Excel.

In the project's repository are all the VBA **Modules** (in .bas format) programmed for the spreadsheet's buttons and functionality. No installation is required, this is just a way to keep them organized.

## Files and Functionalities of the Project 📎

📁 Spreadsheet: **Search Habitica Source**
Contains the search tools for Habitica technical terms (in both languages: 🇺🇸 **EN** and 🇧🇷 **PT-BR**).

📂 Sheet: **Search_Bar**
By selecting the B2 cell next to the search icon, you can type the term which translation you want to find. The **CLEAR** 🚫 button cleans this cell.

* 📌 If the term in the search bar is in 🇺🇸 **EN**, use the button 🇺🇸 **SEARCH EN**. 
* 📌 If the term in the search bar is in 🇧🇷 **PT-BR**, use the button 🇧🇷 **SEARCH PT-BR**.

The sheet returns the original term and translation, and also a label and notes of the string. But only if the term has been previously registered in the spreadsheet database.

📂 Sheet: **Habitica_Technical_Terms**
Database of the spreadsheet. The first sources of this database are in the 📖 #References.
